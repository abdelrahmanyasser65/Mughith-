On the authority of Abdullah bin Omar, may God be pleased with them both, he said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace And he said: “Islam is built on five: testifying that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, establishing prayer, paying zakat, pilgrimage to the House, and fasting Ramadan.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.",
    "inf4":"Who is obligated to pay zakat?",
    "inf5":''' “According to the Hanafi school of thought, zakat must be paid by every sane adult Muslim who possesses an amount of wealth (net assets) that exceeds the nisab limit.

While the Shafi’i, Maliki and Hanbali schools see that zakat is also obligatory for children and the insane, if their wealth reaches the nisab limit.

 

The word “nisab” means the minimum amount of property or wealth/assets that a Muslim must have before he is obligated to start paying Zakat. This minimum amount is called the nisab limit.

You become obligated to pay zakat on the day your wealth reaches the nisab limit. Zakat is calculated and paid on wealth after a full lunar year has passed. The length of the lunar year is about 354 days.

Example: Abdullah recently joined a job, and after one month of work, he received a monthly salary of 1,000 riyals, and Abdullah had no debts. Therefore, his wealth is a thousand riyals in full. The quorum limit at that time was 190 riyals. Thus, Abdullah becomes obligated to pay zakat because his new wealth exceeds the nisab.

After 354 days - a full Hijri year - it is time for Abdullah to reassess his situation and find out how much wealth/net assets he has in excess of the Nisab.

Abdullah found that he had saved 10,000 riyals and had immediate/short-term debts of 2,000 riyals.

Thus, at the end of the Hijri year, Abdullah’s net worth or assets amounted to 8,000 riyals, while the nisab value at that time was 200 riyals.

Therefore, Abdullah will have to pay zakat of 200 riyals, which is 2.5% of the 8,000 riyals.

Many Muslims pay zakat during the month of Ramadan, as it is easier for them to remember when. In many cases, they take it out on the night of the twenty-seventh of Ramadan, seeking to maximize the reward.

However, the most correct legal method is to calculate zakat and pay it after one Hijri year, starting from the day your wealth exceeds the nisab amount.''',

    "al3":"Charity is a very personal charitable act, and is not considered a religious obligation, but it is desirable in Islam. Charity does not depend on financial contributions, but rather includes acts of mercy and generous gestures or generosity of time or effort.",
    "al4":"To whom is charity obligatory?",
    "al5":'''“Praise be to God, and may prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of God, his family, his companions, and those who followed him. Then, to proceed: If what is meant by charity is the obligatory zakat: then it is obligatory for the free Muslim who owns the quorum, and for the two years of the year; It is required for all zakat money except for crops and fruits. Zakat is due on it at the time of harvest. As for those who are entitled to zakat: they are eight categories, mentioned in the sixtieth verse of Surat Al-Tawbah, which is the Almighty’s saying: {Alms are only for the poor and the needy...}, and we will briefly explain what is meant by each of these eight categories: The first and second category: the poor and needy; And they are the people of need who do not find anything, or they find some of what suffices them, on a dispute between the jurists: which of them is the most in need? And detail it in the books of jurisprudence. The third category: those working on zakat; They are the ones who collect zakat, and they are not required to describe poverty. Rather, they give from it even if they are rich. The fourth category: those whose hearts are to be reconciled. And they are the ones who give from the zakat to reconcile their hearts to enter into Islam, and the view of the majority of jurists is that this share remains, not forfeited, unlike the jurists in that. The fifth category: in necks; They are of three types: the first: the Muslim writers; They suffer to untie their necks. The second: the emancipation of a Muslim slave. The third: the Muslim prisoners. The sixth class: Al-Gharmon; They are debtors who are unable to pay their debts, as detailed in the books of jurisprudence. The seventh category: for the sake of God, and what is meant by that is to give the invaders volunteers for jihad, as well as spending in the interest of war, and everything that the matter of jihad needs. The eighth class: Ibn al-Sabeel; He is the passing traveler, whose expenses have been emptied; He is given what he takes to his country. But if what is meant by charity is non-obligatory charity, such as voluntary charity: then it is desirable for every Muslim, and he may spend it as he wishes, and it is better for him to give alms to the closest, so he gives preference to the closest to the closest, taking into account the most needy. he is presented to others; The owners of the “Al-Sunan” narrated on the authority of Salman bin Amer, on the authority of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, who said: “Charity given to the poor is charity, and it is given to the kin of two things: charity and upholding ties of kinship.” He said: “There are two sayings in this verse: one is that it is abrogated by the verse of zakat, and the second is that it shows the expenses of voluntary charity, which is the first, because the abrogation is a claim, and its conditions are non-existent here, and voluntary charity in relatives is better than in others.” And God knows best.
